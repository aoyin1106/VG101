###Ex.1
####Definition of README  
README is a file contains information of other components of a software.
####Content of README  
README directly and clearly demonstrate the structure, content and logic of a software.

###Ex.5
####Method of calculating the circumference of the Earth  
Eratosthenes found at 12:00 a.m, the sun is directly overhead at the Syene city. However, there was meanwhile a shadow at another city, Alexsandria, whose angle with the item was determined to be about 7.2 degrees.  
As the sunlight is parallel, he induced that the surface of the Earth is arcuate. Assuming the Earth as a ball, then the central angle between the two cities is 7.2 degrees.  
Next, he measured the distance between the two cities, which came to be around 5000 STADIA, which is about 800 kilometers.
####Algorithm  
As l=αr, where l is arc length, α is angle and r is radius, the radius of Earth is r=l/α=800/(7.2/360*2π) km.  
Apply  into c=2πr, where c is circumstance, Eratosthenes can thus determine the circumstance of the Earth:  
c=2πr=800/(7.2/360)=40000 km
Hence the circumstance of the Earth is determined.
