Ex. 1 — Pointers, loops, and conditional statements

Input format:
            an integer showing how many numbers are there and an array
            
Output format:
            all the values in the array which are greater than the randomly generated number(which is smaller than the maximum number
            of the arrays)



Ex.2 - Arrays and functions

Input format: 
             none 

Output format: 
             one pair per line, with the order of the original number and the converted one second
             display five decimals

Example output:
              3.00000+0.80000i 3.10483e0.26060i
 
Data type:
             We use double for all the numbers in the exercise for the components of the coordinates 
             may not be an integer.

Structure for Catersian Coordinates:
             one double represents the x component, another double represents the y component

Structure for Polar Coordinates
             one double represents the length, another double represents the radian.

Ex.3 - Strings and file I/O

Input format:
            two txt files called "sentence.txt" and "word.txt" respectivelt
            
Output format:
            a txt file called "count.txt"
            
JOJ score: Accepted




Ex.4 - File I/O, arrays, and loops 

Input format:
             a txt file called "matrices.txt" contains two matrices a and b

Output format:
             a txt file called "result.txt" with resulting matrices in the order addition, multiplication and transpose

JOJ score: Accepted






Ex.6 - Conditional statements, loops, pointers, ASCII code

Input format:
            three or four lines: 
            a string on the first, a number on the second, and a character on the third and fourth line
            (the length of the string is no more than 1,000,000)
            
Output format:
            the prompts and one line with the result
            
Example input 1:
            good morning
            1
             (a space here)
            c
            
Example output 1:
            Input a string: * Choose 1 to replace a character or 2 to delete a character:   Replace character:   with: New string: goodcmorning
            
Example input 2:
            good morning
            2
            d
            
Example output 2:
            Input a string: * Choose 1 to replace a character or 2 to delete a character:   Delete character: New string: goo morning

Ex.7 - Linked lists

1."A linked list is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next." -Wikipedia "Linked list"
  Application: easily remove some element or add some element at the beginning.
  Linked list type: Singly linked list, Doubly linked list, Circular linked list...
