Ex.2 - Arrays and functions

Input format: 
             none 

Output format: 
             one pair per line, with the order of the original number and the converted one second
             display five decimals

Example output:
              3.00000+0.80000i 3.10483e0.26060i
 
Data type:
             We use double for all the numbers in the exercise for the components of the coordinates 
             may not be an integer.

Structure for Catersian Coordinates:
             one double represents the x component, another double represents the y component

Structure for Polar Coordinates
             one double represents the length, another double represents the radian.
