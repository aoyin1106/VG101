Ex.1 - Accurate calculations

Output:
    Total number of grains of wheat: 18446744073709551615

Notes:
    We use the formula 2^0+2^1+...+2^63=2^64-1.
    Also, we can also use the function 'sym' in MATLAB, which was introduced by the strongest LYH in Monday's lab. sym(2^64-1)=18446744073709551615.



Ex.3 - Input and output

Input format:
    An integer.
Output format:
    All the multiples n * i, 0 <= i <= 10. The output can be found in 'Ex3_Output.txt'. See the problem description of Ex.3.

Example input:
    Ex3(23)
Example output:
    See 'Ex3_Output.txt'.



Ex.4 - Ploting

Output:
    An image including a pretty house and a red Volkswagen Beetle car.



Ex.5 - Algorithm, function, conditional statements, and loops

Input format:
    a function(f), an interval(a,b),error(error)
Output format:
    'the root is xxx'
    
Example input:
    Ex5(@(x)x^2+2*x-5,1,2,0.001)
Example output:
    the root is 1.449463
    


Ex.6 - Input and output

Input format:
    A positive integer n. (Better if 2 <= n <= 16)
Output format:
    n lines of Pascal's triangle in 'Ex6_Output.txt'. See the problem description of Ex.6.

Example input:
    Ex6(6)
Example output:
    See 'Ex6_Output.txt'.
