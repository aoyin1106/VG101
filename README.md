## About HC
This repository belongs to VG101 2018SU Full Assignment Group 1. If you are from other groups, you should not copy any code here, or you will eat an HC, which is not delicious. Also, although I have uploaded everything about my project, I don't think it's a good idea to open that folder...

## Who is the strongest in JI?
That's a good question. I think it must be LYH. He won't be able to find this page anyway.
